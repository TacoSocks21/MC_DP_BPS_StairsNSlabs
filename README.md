## Data Pack Description

This data pack aims to make stairs and slabs less of a hassel by creating a cyclical relationship between blocks, stairs, and slabs, hence the "Block, Paper, Scissors" title, as well as making these recipes accessible for inventory crafting:
- Craft any slab into its respective block or stair variants
- Craft any stair into its respective block or slab variant
- Add 2x2-crafting recipes for any block into its respective stair or slab variant.

## Overridden Vanilla Recipes

Because of my custom recipes for stairs, I had to change the way you get pressure plates. To match the balancing of this data pack, I updated the vanilla recipe for all stairs to yeild 8 instead of 4.
